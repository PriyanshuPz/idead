    <p>
        Idead is an idea graveyard: a place for unfinished concepts to remain visible instead of getting lost in
        private notes. It treats abandoned work as part of the creative process rather than a record of failure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-muted">
        The platform is designed for reflective capture, lightweight browsing, and practical recovery of ideas that
        may still be useful in a different season.

        <p>
            Many project concepts never reach completion, even when the thinking behind them has value. Over time,
            these partial ideas are usually forgotten or buried in scattered files.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            Idead was built to preserve that unfinished thinking in a single place where it can be revisited with more
            context and less friction.

            The graveyard metaphor reframes abandonment as archival. Each entry records what the idea was, why it was
            paused, and how difficult it felt when it was active.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            This creates visibility into abandoned paths and makes it easier to spot patterns across discarded work.

    </div>
    <p>
        Users bury ideas by submitting a title, description, reason for abandonment, and a perceived difficulty class.
        Buried ideas appear in the yard, where they can be inspected, upvoted, and reported.

        The dashboard surfaces a trending idea and a random suggestion to help users revisit dormant concepts and
        recover viable directions.
